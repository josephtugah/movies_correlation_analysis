# Can we help movie producers and other stakeholder know the determing factors driving gross earnings?
## Background
A movie has many attributes such as genre, company of production, year of release, budget, IMDb user rating, country, gross revenue and others. Which of these
factors most impact the gross revenue that is earned from the movie? The stakeholders need to understand these factors and their level of impact on revenue so 
that they are informed to invest their resources into the right channnels based on insights derived from data rather than making guesses which can be costly.

## The data analysis process
- What movie attributes strongly impact the gross earnings of a movie?
### Defining the question
### Gathering data
- I used a secondary data sourced from kaggle. The data file is uploaded in csv format.
### Preparing the data
- I cleaned and validated the data using python. I dealt with missing values and performed data validation, checking the data types and other data attributes.
- The processes are clearly detailed in the python file.
### Exploring the data
- I explored the distribution of the data, used descriptive statistics and summary tables to understand and present some important findings. These included determining
which movie genres were generating more revenue and how much it cost to make such movies, understanding the spread in the revenue of movies across various genres.
### Analyzing the data
I performed correlation analysis to determine what kind of relationship exists between other data attributes and the gross earnings. 
### Visualization and Communication
I used the seaborn package to visualize and interpret the findings, based on which I made recommendations
