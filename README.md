# What attributes of a movie strongly affect the gross earnings?
## Background
A movie has many attributes such as genre, company of production, year of release, budget, IMDb user rating, country, gross revenue and others. Which of these
factors most impact the gross revenue that is earned from the movie? The stakeholders need to understand these factors and their level of impact on revenue so 
that they are informed to invest their resources into the right channnels based on insights derived from data rather than making guesses which can be costly.

## The data analysis process
### Gathering data

- The processes are clearly detailed in the python file.
### Exploring the data
- I explored the distribution of the data, used descriptive statistics and summary tables to understand and present some important findings.
### Analyzing the data
I performed correlation analysis to determine what kind of relationship exists between other data attributes and the gross earnings
